</div><!--header-->
<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>The Input system is inherited from the original implementation in Urho3D game engine.</p>
<p>The Input subsystem provides keyboard, mouse, joystick and touch input both via a polled interface and events. This subsystem is also used for querying whether the application window has input focus or is minimized.</p>
<p>The subsystem is always instantiated, even in headless mode, but is active only once the application window has been created. Once active, the subsystem takes over the operating system mouse cursor. It will be hidden by default, so the UI should be used to render a software cursor if necessary. For editor-like applications the operating system cursor can be made visible by calling SetMouseVisible().</p>
<p>The input events include:</p>
<ul>
<li>E_MOUSEBUTTONUP: a mouse button was released.</li>
<li>E_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN: a mouse button was pressed.</li>
<li>E_MOUSEMOVE: the mouse moved.</li>
<li>E_MOUSEWHEEL: the mouse wheel moved.</li>
<li>E_KEYUP: a key was released.</li>
<li>E_KEYDOWN: a key was pressed.</li>
<li>E_TEXTINPUT: a string of translated text input in UTF8 format. May - contain a single character or several.</li>
<li>E_JOYSTICKCONNECTED: a joystick was plugged in.</li>
<li>E_JOYSTICKDISCONNECTED: a joystick was disconnected.</li>
<li>E_JOYSTICKBUTTONDOWN: a joystick button was pressed.</li>
<li>E_JOYSTICKBUTTONUP: a joystick button was released.</li>
<li>E_JOYSTICKAXISMOVE: a joystick axis was moved.</li>
<li>E_JOYSTICKHATMOVE: a joystick POV hat was moved.</li>
<li>E_TOUCHBEGIN: a finger touched the screen.</li>
<li>E_TOUCHEND: a finger was lifted from the screen.</li>
<li>E_TOUCHMOVE: a finger moved on the screen.</li>
<li>E_GESTURERECORDED : recording a touch gesture is complete.</li>
<li>E_GESTUREINPUT : a touch gesture was recognized.</li>
<li>E_MULTIGESTURE : a multi-finger pinch/rotation touch gesture is - underway.</li>
<li>E_DROPFILE : a file was drag-dropped on the application window.</li>
<li>E_INPUTFOCUS : application input focus or window minimization state - changed.</li>
<li>E_MOUSEVISIBLECHANGED : the visibility of the operating system mouse - cursor was changed.</li>
<li>E_EXITREQUESTED : application exit was requested (eg. with the window - close button.)</li>
<li>E_INPUTBEGIN : input handling starts.</li>
<li>E_INPUTEND : input handling ends.</li>
<li>E_SDLRAWINPUT : raw SDL event is sent for customized event processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a sample code for handling the E_MOUSEBUTTONUP event in Urho3D:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"> {c++}</div>
<div class="line">void HandleMouseUp(StringHash eventType, VariantMap&amp; eventData)</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">    using namespace MouseButtonDown;</div>
<div class="line">    const MouseButton button = static_cast&lt;MouseButton&gt;(eventData[P_BUTTON].GetInt());</div>
<div class="line">    if (button == MOUSEB_LEFT)</div>
<div class="line">    {</div>
<div class="line">        // Handle left mouse button up</div>
<div class="line">    }</div>
<div class="line">    else if (button == MOUSEB_RIGHT)</div>
<div class="line">    {</div>
<div class="line">        // Handle right mouse button up</div>
<div class="line">    }</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"><div class="line"> {c++}</div>
<div class="line">SubscribeToEvent(E_MOUSEBUTTONUP, &amp;MyApplication::HandleMouseUp);</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>This code subscribes to the E_MOUSEBUTTONUP event and handles it in the HandleMouseUp function. The eventData parameter contains information about the event, such as which mouse button was released. In this example, the code checks whether the left or right mouse button was released and handles it accordingly.</p>
<h1>Input Map</h1>
<p>The InputMap class is responsible for mapping keyboard keys, gamepad buttons, or axis movement to logical actions in a game engine. The class provides an interface for defining and managing input mappings, which can be used to trigger specific actions in the game.</p>
<p>The InputMap is serializable. You can define default map in game resources and override in a configuration folder. Because of that it is recommended to use the helper method to load the map: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"> {c++}</div>
<div class="line">/// Load input map from config file or resource.</div>
<div class="line">void LoadInputMap(const ea::string&amp; name);</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>The method looks up map in configuration folder first and only if it is missing there it loads one from resources.</p>
<p>If you have no intention to allow user to define key mappings you can fetch it from ResourceCache as any other resource.</p>
<p>To map a keyboard key you can use MapKeyboardKey. </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"> {c++}</div>
<div class="line">map-&gt;MapKeyboardKey(&quot;Forward&quot;, SCANCODE_W);</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Keyboard mapping is based on scancodes. Scancodes are unique codes assigned to each key on a keyboard. They are used to identify the physical key pressed, regardless of the keyboard layout or language. In games, scancodes are used to support international keyboard layouts by providing a consistent way to identify keys across different keyboards and languages.</p>
<p>For example, if a game uses the "WASD" keys for movement, it can map the scancodes for those keys to the movement action in the game. This allows players to use any keyboard layout or language and still be able to move their character using the same physical keys. For example in France, the most commonly used keyboard layout is AZERTY. It is similar to the QWERTY layout used in English-speaking countries, but with a few differences. For example, the letters A and Q are swapped, as are the letters Z and W.</p>
<p>To get value from the map use Evaluate method. </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"> {c++}</div>
<div class="line">const float forward = map-&gt;Evaluate(&quot;Forward&quot;);</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>This means that the map finds a matching mapping and reads its value directly from Input system. The value returned is between 0 and 1, where 0 means the key is not pressed and 1 means the key is pressed. Some input devices have analog input, which means you can get any value between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>To map gamepad analog stick axis use MapJoystickAxis or MapControllerAxis method. </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"> {c++}</div>
<div class="line">/// Map generic joystick axis to the action.</div>
<div class="line">void MapJoystickAxis(const ea::string&amp; action, unsigned axis, float neutral, float pressed);</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">/// Map controller axis to the action.</div>
<div class="line">void MapControllerAxis(const ea::string&amp; action, ControllerAxis axis, float neutral, float pressed);</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>The method takes four parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>action: A string that specifies the logical action that should be affected when the joystick axis is moved.</li>
<li>axis: For generic joystick the value is an unsigned integer that specifies the joystick axis to map. For a controller the value is ControllerAxis that specifies the controller axis.</li>
<li>neutral: A float value that specifies the neutral position of the joystick axis. This value should be between -1 and 1. For analog sticks it is 0. For triggers the neutral position is -1.</li>
<li>pressed: A float value that specifies the position of the joystick axis when it is fully pressed. This value should be between -1 and 1. Usually the value is either -1 or 1 exactly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Evaluate method return value of the joystick axis is mapped to a range between neutral and pressed, where neutral represents the neutral position of the joystick and pressed represents the position of the joystick when it is fully pressed.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to map the Y-axis of a gamepad to control the movement of a character in your game, you can use the following code: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"> {c++}</div>
<div class="line">map-&gt;MapControllerAxis(&quot;Forward&quot;, CONTROLLER_AXIS_LEFTY, 0.0f, -1.0f);</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>This code maps the negative Y-axis portion of the gamepad analog stick to affect the "Forward" action in your game. The neutral position of the Y-axis is set to 0.0f, which means that when the joystick is in its neutral position, the value of "Forward" will be 0.0f. The fully pressed position of the Y-axis is set to -1.0f, which means that when the axis is fully pressed forward, the value of "Forward" will be 1.0f. </p>
